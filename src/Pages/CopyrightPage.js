									Devdra Limited provides users with an online
									platform and social media website (the
									“Devdra Platform”) and allows users to
									upload and share images, videos, and other
									content to the Devdra Platform. We take the
									rights of intellectual property owners very
									seriously and comply as a service provider
									with all applicable provisions of the United
									States Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
								</p>

								<p>
									As stated in our End User License Agreement
									and Terms of Service, Devdra enforces its
									policy barring the upload of infringing
									material onto the Devdra Platform. We
									respect the rights of copyright owners and
									we ask that you do the same.
								</p>

								<h3>What is copyright?</h3>
								<p>
									Copyright is the right of an author of a
									creative work to prevent others from using
									that work, including performing or
									displaying the work publicly, reproducing a
									work, distributing a work, or using it to
									create new works (a derivative work). We
									strongly encourage users of the Devdra
									Platform to familiarize themselves with
									copyright law before uploading content on
									the Devdra Platform. We offer the following
									links to copyright law resources for
									informational purposes only:

								<h3>
									What types of materials are copyrighted?
								</h3>
								<p>
									Copyright can cover almost any creative
									expression, including photographs, images,
									videos, audio/visual creations, live
									streams, articles, and other works of
									authorship. If you did not create a work and
									do not have the consent of the copyright
									holder to publish or use it (e.g., upload it
									to the Devdra Platform), your use of that
									work may be unauthorized and you may be
									subject to liability for copyright
									infringement.
								</p>

								<h3>
									What happens if I upload content to the
									Devdra Platform for which I don’t own the
									copyright, have a license to use the work,
									or have consent of the copyright holder?
								</h3>
								<p>
									If you upload content and you don’t own the
									copyright and don’t have permission to
									upload, reproduce, distribute, publicly
									perform, or create a derivative work of that
									content or any portion of that content, you
									may be sued by the copyright owner thereof
									for copyright infringement. The damages for
									copyright infringement can be severe. In the
									United States, statutory damages (available
									to a copyright owner without proving actual
									harm) can range from $750 - $30,000 per work
									infringed, and run as high as $150,000 for
									willful infringement. Damages vary in other
									jurisdictions.
								</p>

								<p>
									If we are notified that material you have
									uploaded to the Devdra Platform infringes
									someone’s copyright, we will notify you and
									take down the content you posted. This is
									required by law. If you persist in uploading
									unauthorized content, we will, pursuant to
									our Repeat Infringer Policy, ban you from
									using the Devdra Platform.
								</p>

								<h3>What about fair use?</h3>
								<p>
									The “fair use” doctrine is an affirmative
									defense to copyright infringement in the
									United States that allows the use of a work
									for certain limited purposes such as
									criticism, commentary, parody, news
									reporting, research, and teaching. Fair use
									is a complicated doctrine, and it is an open
									question whether a particular use of a
									copyrighted work constitutes fair use. You
									are responsible for the content you upload
									to the Devdra Platform and may be liable for
									money damages if it is determined that you
									wrongly assumed that your use of certain
									content constituted “fair use”.

								<h3>
									Further Information Regarding Copyright
									Infringement:
								</h3>
								<p>
									The extent to which content uploaded to the
									Devdra Platform makes use of a copyrighted
									work may not matter: even the use of a small
									portion of a copyrighted work may cause you
									to be liable for copyright infringement.
								</p>

								<p>
									A copyright notice (i.e., © or ℗) is
									generally not required for a work to be
									protected by copyright law.
								</p>

								<p>
									Distributing content containing copyrighted
									material without the copyright owner’s
									permission may be a violation of copyright
									law even if you give the content away for
									free.
								</p>

								<p>
									There is no exception for “private” copying
									in U.S. law. Even if you share a work with
									only a small group of your friends or
									family, you could still be liable for
									copyright infringement.
								</p>

								<p>
									You can be liable for copyright infringement
									even if you give attribution to the owner or
									author of the copyrighted content.
								</p>

								<p>
									Even if you used your creativity to create
									new content that contains another person’s
									copyrighted work, you may be liable for
									copyright infringement.
