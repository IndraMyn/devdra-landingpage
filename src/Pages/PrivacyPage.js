									<h2>About Our Privacy Policy</h2>
									<p>
										Devdra Limited is a media company. Our
										mission is to make the world happier.
									</p>
									<p>
										The Devdra services that link to this
										Privacy Policy provide fun ways for you
										to create, share, and discover the best
										content in the world.
									</p>
									<p>
										When you use these services, you’ll
										share some information with us. We want
										to explain clearly what information we
										collect, why we collect it, how we use
										it, whom we share it with, and the
										controls we give you to access, update,
										and delete your information.
									</p>
									<p>
										That’s why we’ve written this Privacy
										Policy. We tried to write it in simple
										language with minimal legalese so it’s
										easy for you to understand. If you have
										any questions about anything in our
										Privacy Policy, please contact us.
									</p>

								<div id="content-informationwecollect-privacypolicy">
									<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
									<p>
										There are three basic categories of
										information we collect:
									</p>
									<ol>
										<li>
											<strong>
												Information you choose to give
												us
											</strong>
										</li>
										<li>
											<strong>

									<h2>How We Collect Information</h2>
									<h3>Information You Choose To Give Us</h3>
									<p>
										When you use and interact with our
										services, we collect the information you
										choose to share with us. For example,
										most of our services require you to set
										up a basic Devdra account, so we need to
										collect a few important details about
										you, such as: a unique username you
										choose, a password, an e-mail address,
										and your date of birth. To make it
										easier for others to find you, we may
										also ask you to provide us additional
										information that will be publicly
										visible on our services, for example a
										profile picture, a name, or other
										identifiable information. Our other
										services, such as commerce products, may
										also require you to provide us with a
										debit card or credit card number and its
										associated account information.
									</p>
									<p>
										You’ll also provide any information you
										send through our services, such as post
										and comment uploads. Keep in mind that
										the posts and comments you upload can be
										seen publicly, and can always be saved
										and copied outside of our services.
										Please don’t share content you wouldn’t
										want someone to save or share.
									</p>
									<p>
										Lastly, when you contact us or
										communicate with us in any way, we’ll
										collect any information you give us.
									</p>
